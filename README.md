# Hi there, I'm Glen! 🚀

I am an **AI Engineer & MLOps Specialist** currently completing my **MS in Data Science at the University at Buffalo**. I specialize in bridging the gap between experimental LLM research and resilient, self-healing production infrastructure.

My work focuses on building **autonomous multi-agent frameworks**, **agentic RAG architectures**, and **automated MLOps pipelines** that prioritize reliability, security, and observability.
